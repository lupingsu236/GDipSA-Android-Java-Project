# GDipSA Android Java Project
Android app for picture matching memory game developed by my team for NUS-ISS GDipSA course

## Project Specifications / Requirements 
This is a simple Android app memory game on matching pictures. 
The player first selects a difficulty level for the game (Easy for 6 pictures, Normal for 8 pictures and Hard for 10 pictures), before he is prompted to enter a URL address. The first 20 pictures on the URL is retrieved (via HTML webscraping) for the user to select for the game. The picture matching memory game is whereby the player taps on two placeholders to reveal the pictures behind it. If pictures don't match, it will be 'flipped' back to the placeholders again. The aim is to find all matching pairs in the shortest time possible.
Features for this game include: 
1. 3 Difficulty Levels 
2. Retrieval of Pictures from URL provided
3. Picture Matching Memory Game 
4. Background Music and Sound Effects for Game
5. Game Pause and Restart 
6. LeaderBoard (3 fastest timings for each difficulty level)
